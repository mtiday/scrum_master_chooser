This program randomly chooses a name from a list called
scrum_list_current.txt. When the name is choosen it's removed from the list.
You can reload the list from scrum_list_full.txt at any time.
You can add or remove a name from either name. You can remove a name from
this round of choosing, and the name is added back in after a new SCRUM master
is choosen.
